This is a semester project participating in the "Interactive Design Media" class for the MSc in Design and Digital Media (2009-2010) at the University of Edinburgh.

For this project the project brief asked for an interactive game made in Flash. I created 2 jigsaw puzzles that, when completed, play the small video relevant to the completed image.

For more information on the assignment please refer the project brief.
